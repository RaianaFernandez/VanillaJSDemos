📚Vanilla JS Demos: Interview Preparation & Core Skills
This repository contains a collection of small, focused web applications built using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

These projects were created as part of my technical interview preparation to demonstrate a strong understanding of core web development fundamentals, DOM manipulation, asynchronous programming, and clean code practices.

🎯 Repository Intent and Focus
The primary goal of this repository is to prove mastery of JavaScript features that form the foundation for all modern frameworks (like React). 
Each demo focuses on a critical, isolated skill:Skill DemonstratedImportanceDOM ManipulationCreating, updating, and deleting elements dynamically.Event HandlingManaging user interactions (clicks, input changes) cleanly.Asynchronous JavaScriptFetching and processing data from external APIs.Data MappingTranslating server data (JSON) into user interface elements.

## 💻 Projects Overview

| Demo Name | Key Concepts Demonstrated | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SimpleTasksList Demo** | DOM Manipulation, Event Listeners, State Management (Toggle/Delete), Modern Event Delegation (`.closest()`). | A classic To-Do application demonstrating how to dynamically create, manage, and remove elements in a list structure. **Crucial practice for managing dynamic UI.** |
| **Comment Form Demo** | Form Handling, Input Validation, Dynamic Content Insertion. | Focuses on capturing user input, performing simple validation checks, and inserting new, structured content (like a comment) into the DOM. |
| **WishList Demo** | Form Handling, Input Validation, Dynamic Content Insertion and Editing. | Shows how to use prompt command to edit the items in the wishlist|
| **Content Fetch Demo** | Asynchronous JavaScript, `fetch()` API, Promises, Error Handling. | A core demo for back-end communication, showing how to retrieve data from a remote API and handle the success or failure of the network request. |
| **Social Media Demo** | API Integration, Data Mapping, Dynamic Rendering, Custom Styling. | The most complex demo, demonstrating the rendering of API data (user posts, names, images) into a structured UI layout. |

## 🛠️ Technology Used

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure for all demos.
* **CSS3:** Styling, layout (Flexbox/Grid), and custom visual effects (e.g., Polaroid design).
* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** All core logic, DOM manipulation, asynchronous programming, and data handling.
